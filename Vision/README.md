### CIFAR-10 Experiments
I intend to run experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, including but not limited to:
* Impact of learning rate regimes on convergence in loss.
* Impact of network architectures on convergence in loss.
* Impact of regularization schemes on convergence in loss.
* Impact of data augmentation regimes on convergence in loss.

I am writing my own wrapper called 'tau' on top of PyTorch to conduct my experiments.
